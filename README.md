## About Me
I am a results-driven SOC and SOAR Specialist with 6.5+ years of experience optimising security operations for enterprise and cloud environments. My mission? To stay ahead of evolving threats by leveraging SOAR, AI/ML and cutting-edge security tools to enhance security operations, incident detection, response, and threat hunting capabilities. Committed to delivering secure and resilient solutions in fast-paced, innovative environments, 
Below are some of my notable open-source projects that reflect my expertise and creativity.


## Projects

### [NLP Based Phishing Email Detector](https://github.com/GauravCyberAI/Phishing-Emails-Detection-Using-Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Techniques)
The static email features can be easily manipulated by skilled attackers. As a result, my research proposes an advanced solution for identifying phishing attempts that goes beyond traditional static email features. By analysing the content of emails, we aim to create a more robust and reliable method for detecting phishing attempts using different NLP techniques such as,
- Sentiment Analysis, 
- Textual Content Analysis
- Semantic Features
- Linguistic Features

### [Phishing URL Detector Using ML](https://github.com/GauravCyberAI/Phishing-URL-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning)
The objective of this project is to use Machine Learning model to predict whether a URL is phishing or not. The ML model is trained using over 50,000 datasets of benign and phishing URLs by extracting the most important features from the specified URL. 
During this feature extraction, the following features are used: 
1. URL-Based Features
2. Domain-Based Features 
3. Page-Based Features
4. Content-Based Features
